# 🩺 Diabetes Multiple Regression Project

This project demonstrates a **Multiple Linear Regression** model using the Diabetes dataset from sklearn.  
We predict the **progression of diabetes** based on several medical features:

- **BMI** (Body Mass Index)  
- **BP** (Blood Pressure)  
- **s1, s2** (serum measurements)

## 🚀 Project Steps

1. Load the Diabetes dataset from sklearn.  
2. Select multiple features for prediction.  
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
4. Train a Linear Regression model on the training set.  
5. Predict disease progression on the test set.  
6. Evaluate the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.  
7. Check **feature importance** to see which features have higher impact.  
8. Visualize actual vs predicted --
